## Project Description

During my summer internship at EJADA, I worked on building a data warehouse based on the AdventureWorks database, applying concepts like staging area and ETL using SSIS, and using Power BI for data preparation, analysis, and visualization. The following sections provide an overview of my work with detailed explanations and screenshots.

## SSIS Work

### Overview

The SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services) packages were designed to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data from various sources into the data warehouse. The ETL process included:

- Extracting data from the AdventureWorks database.
- Transforming the data to meet business requirements.
- Loading the transformed data into the data warehouse.

## Power BI Work

### Overview

In the Power BI section of the project, I focused on creating interactive and insightful visualizations to analyze the data stored in the data warehouse. The Power BI reports included:

- Summary metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs).
- Visualizations such as line charts, bar charts, and maps.
- Detailed analysis of customer, product, and geographical data.
